# Hi there ğŸ‘‹ I am Chara!

## Web Developer based in Vienna, Austria.

I recently made a 180 degree career turn from sales to web development because I realized that I really like building websites. 


ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on several projects, among which is my e-commerce website and my final project, which is a Food Diary to help people track what they eat on a daily basis.

ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning PERN stack on UpLeveled bootcamp.
