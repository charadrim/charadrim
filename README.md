## Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I am Chara!

#### Web Developer based in Vienna, Austria.

I recently made a 180 degree career turn from sales to web development because I realized that building websites is my passion. 


ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning PERN stack on UpLeveled bootcamp.

ðŸš€ I'm developing with JavaScript, TypeScript, React, Next.js, Node.js and PostgreSQL, but I am always learning new technologies and growing my skills.

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on several projects, among which is my e-commerce website and my final project, which is a Food Diary to help people track what they eat on a daily basis.
